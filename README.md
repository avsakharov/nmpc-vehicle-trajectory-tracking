# NMPC: Vehicle Trajectory Tracking

This project focuses on developing a vehicle control algorithm using **NMPC** (Nonlinear Model Predictive Control) to follow a predefined trajectory.

## Objective

To develop a mathematical model of a vehicle and design an autonomous control system capable of following a given 2D trajectory using NMPC.

## Project Contents

- `nmpc_vehicle_trajectory_tracking.py` — main Python script implementing the algorithm
- `nmpc_vehicle_trajectory_tracking.pdf` — documentation and illustrations
- `nmpc_vehicle_trajectory_tracking.gif` — visualization of the algorithm in action

## Libraries used
numpy, scipy, casadi, matplotlib
