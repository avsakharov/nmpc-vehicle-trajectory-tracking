# NMPC: Vehicle Trajectory Tracking

This project focuses on developing a vehicle control algorithm using **NMPC** (Nonlinear Model Predictive Control) to follow a predefined trajectory.

## Objective

To develop a mathematical model of a vehicle and design an autonomous control system capable of following a given 2D trajectory using NMPC.
